# Sales-Forcast-using-Machine-Learning

Sales forecasting using machine learning is the process of predicting future sales based on historical data and other relevant variables. It involves training a machine learning model on historical sales data and then using that model to make predictions about future sales.
I got the data from a Kaggle dataset and performed my analysis using Linear regression in the jupyter notebook.
